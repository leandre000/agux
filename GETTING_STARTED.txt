GETTING STARTED WITH AGURA
===========================

1. Clone the repository and enter the directory:
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd agura

2. Install all dependencies (including native and dev dependencies):
   npm install

3. (Optional but recommended) Check for any issues with dependencies or setup:
   npx expo-doctor
   # This runs expo doctor to check for environment and dependency issues.

4. (Optional) Analyze installed packages and their versions:
   npm list --depth=0
   # Shows a flat list of all installed packages and their versions.

5. (Optional) Clean the project if you run into issues:
   npm run clean
   npm install
   # Removes node_modules and lock file, then reinstalls everything.

6. Start the project (choose your platform):
   # For all platforms (Expo Dev Tools):
   npm run dev
   # Android:
   npm run android
   # iOS (Mac only):
   npm run ios
   # Web:
   npm run web

7. (Optional) Lint the codebase:
   npm run lint


TROUBLESHOOTING NON-ZERO EXIT ERRORS
====================================
If you or your boss encounter a 'non-zero exit code' or similar error during 'npm install' or when starting the project:

1. Run the clean script to remove old dependencies and lock files:
   npm run clean

2. Reinstall all dependencies:
   npm install

3. Try starting the project again:
   npm run dev

If the error persists, ensure you are using a supported version of Node.js (preferably the latest LTS) and that you have a stable internet connection. If you still have issues, please contact the project maintainer for support.


FIXING EXPO DOCTOR ISSUES
=========================
If you see warnings about outdated dependencies or image dimensions:

1. For dependency issues, run:
   npm install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage@2.1.2 react-native-svg@15.11.2

2. For image dimension warnings (icon.png and adaptive-icon.png):
   - These are warnings only and won't prevent the app from running
   - The images should ideally be square (e.g., 1024x1024) for best compatibility
   - You can replace them with properly sized images if needed

3. After fixing issues, run again:
   npx expo-doctor

The app will work fine even with these warnings, but fixing them ensures optimal compatibility.
